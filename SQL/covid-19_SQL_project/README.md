# SQL COVID-19 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

### Objective
For this project, I employed two datasets encompassing worldwide Covid-19 data spanning from January, 2020, to July, 2021, focusing primarily on fatalities and immunization rates. Employing MySQL, I delved into the data to uncover intriguing trends. Throughout the project, I skillfully applied techniques such as Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions and Aggregate Functions. Subsequently, I harnessed the knowledge gleaned from these datasets and insights to populate POWER-BI, crafting an informative dashboard.

### Steps followed to get the project up and running:
1. Creation of tables for the fatalities and immunixations.
2. Loading the data into the DB using the command line client.
3. Analysis of the data using Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions and Aggregate Functions.

### Top insights
1. The top 3 nations with the greatest proportion of infected individuals include Andorra, Seychelles, and Montenegro.
2. Europe has the highest no of fatalities while Africa has the least.
3. The countries with the highest fatalities are USA, Brazil, and India.
4. Malta is the front runner in adoption of the vaccine. It has the greatest proportion of people that have been fully vaccinated and the greatest proportion of newly vaccinated people as of 2021-07-04.
